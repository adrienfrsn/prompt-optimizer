# Prompt Optimizer

A web application that automatically improves AI prompts (for GPT, Claude, Gemini, etc.) and asks follow-up questions when the prompt is too vague.  
This project was created to get hands-on experience with Vue.js and Spring Boot, while integrating the OpenAI API.

---

## Features

- Analyze user prompts to check if they're clear enough
- Automatically optimize prompts based on the selected model (GPT-3.5, GPT-4, Claude 3, Geminiâ€¦)
- Generate clarifying questions when needed
- Frontend built with Vue.js + Tailwind CSS
- Backend using Spring Boot (Java) + OpenAI API
- User registration and login system
